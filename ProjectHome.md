An open source mapping library for embedding maps directly into your own iPhone/iPad windows and views.  Unlike the Map Kit Framework, **Route-Map** provides support for map data from sources other then Google Maps.  **Route-Map** is an updated library based on [Route-Me](http://route-me.googlecode.com/).

## Current Status ##
The current implementation of Route-Map is based on the CacheNT branch of Route-Me and most of the changes made in trunk up to May 2010.  The CacheNT branch implements a cacheing mechanism with a lean, high performance, multi-threaded caching infrastructure.
